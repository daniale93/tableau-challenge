In this Tableau workbook you will find Citi Bike Station data from New Jersey in 2020. 

The first thing I wanted to look at was which stations were the most popular stations to start and stop trips this year. The maps are very even, indicating that no particular stations are used mostly for only starting or only ending trips.
The most popular stations are all closer to the bridges that connect to Manhattan, indicating that many of the users use these to travel to NYC. 

Another phenomenom analyzed in this file is the effect of COVID and its lockdowns. We can see a clear decrease for people of all ages/genders right around April, when the first lockdowns where implemented. After, it slowly kept going back to normal levels and with summer the numbers came back up. 
Normally summer months would be busier than the winter, but because NYC did not have its usual tourism and many people either left NYC or were working from home, bike usage was bit as high. When winter started in November, and another large wave of Covid cases, bike usage went down once again.
